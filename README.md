_______________
The project 2.10 MW Wind Power Project activity by Knack Packaging Private Limited (Herein
after called as Project Proponent “PP”) is a wind power project located at Village-Moti Bhalsan,
Taluka-Jamnagar, District Jamnagar, State Gujarat, Country India. The Project is an operational
activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon
Registry” (UCR).

The details of the registered project are as follows:
Purpose of the project activity:
The main purpose of the project activity is the operation of 2.10 MW Wind Power Project to
generated electricity in high wind areas of Gujarat. The Project is undertaken by Knack Packaging
Private Limited The Project consists of 2.10 MW Wind Turbine generators (WTG). The
commissioning date of the Wind Turbine Generator is as shown below.

The project will generate approximately 6,142 MWh of electricity per annum. The net generated
electricity from the project activity is for captive consumption by the project proponent. Wheeling
agreement is signed between PP and Uttar Gujarat VIJ Company Limited-UGVCL. The project
activity has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable
resources (Wind Energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated using
grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal power plants. The estimated
annual average and the total CO2 emission reduction by the project activity is expected to be 5,528
t/CO2, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU shall be submitted as a part
of first monitoring and verification.
